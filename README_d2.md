**Heart Disease Predictor**
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of health parameters using machine learning.

**Project Description**
In this project, we predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on the following features:

- Age
- Gender
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure
- ECG results
- Max heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina

We use classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees to predict heart disease and evaluate their performance.

**Files**
- `app.py`: Flask application for the web interface.
- `model.py`: Contains the code for training the model and making predictions.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
